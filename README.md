# LING 78100 Homework 2

Please consult the syllabus for detailed instructions regarding how to submit programming assignments and a list of grading criteria. Deadline: Monday, October 16th, 2017

Note: Please submit assignments via the Github Classroom

You may either create individual .py files for each problem or solve each problem in its own cell in an ipython notebook.  If you create individual files, you should also create an ipython notebook that imports each file and demonstrates that the imported functions work on the test cases described below.  If you use one large ipython notebook for everything, you should demonstrate that your functions work on the test cases described below in the same notebook.

## Problem 1 : Chapter 5, Programming Exercise 4 (page 171) "Acronyms"
You should demonstrate that your program works by testing it on four different phrases. (You
can pick the four phrases to use as sample inputs.)

## Problem 2 : Chapter 5, Programming Exercise 14 (page 173) "Word Count"
You should demonstrate that your program works by testing it on the files sample1.txt and sample2.txt that are included in this repository.

## Problem 3 : Chapter 7, Programming Exercise 6 (page 239) "Speed Limit"
You should demonstrate that your program works by testing it on the following inputs: speed
limit 25 and clocked speed of 34, speed limit of 25 and clocked speed of 25, and speed limit of 60
and clocked speed of 93.

## Problem 4 : Chapter 7, Programming Exercise 12 (page 240) "Valid or Invalid Dates"
You should demonstrate that your program works by testing it on three valid dates and three
invalid dates. (You can pick the dates to use as sample inputs.)

## Problem 5 : Chapter 4, Programming Exercise 9 (page 127) "Rectangle Information"
You should demonstrate that your program works by testing it on two different sets of inputs (i.e., two different sets of "clicks" of the mouse on the graphics window). You should include a screenshot image of the graphics window that is produced (with the rectangle drawn), and you should also provide the output text that is printed to the screen.
